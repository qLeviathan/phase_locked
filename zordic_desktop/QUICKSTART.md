## Step 1: Install Dependencies (30 seconds)

```bash
cd zordic_desktop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Expected output:
```
âœ“ Successfully installed numpy-1.x.x matplotlib-3.x.x scipy-1.x.x
```

## Step 2: Launch Application (10 seconds)

```bash
python run_zordic.py
```

Or:
```bash
./run_zordic.py
```

Expected output:
```

## Step 3: Run Your First Analysis (1 minute)

1. **Window opens** - You'll see the ZORDIC interface with dark theme

2. **Input field** (top left) - Contains default text: "quantum field theory"

3. **Click âš¡ ANALYZE** button

4. **Watch the magic:**
   - Log updates in real-time (bottom left)
   - Metrics appear (middle left)
   - 4 graphs populate (right side)

5. **Results shown:**
   - Blue/red field plots (top right)
   - Stability bar chart (middle right) - green=stable, orange=unstable
   - Convergence curve (bottom right)
   - Regime classification in metrics

## What You're Seeing

### The Logs (bottom left)
```
=== PHASE 1: ENCODING ===
[0] 'q' â†’ shells=[17], Ï†=1597.000, Ïˆ=0.000, Î”=1597.000
[1] 'u' â†’ shells=[8], Ï†=21.000, Ïˆ=0.000, Î”=21.000
...
âœ“ Encoded 20 characters
```

Each character becomes a point in Ï†-space with specific "shells" (Fibonacci indices).

### The Metrics (middle left)
```
INITIAL STATE:
  Ï†-field total:    15234.567
  Ïˆ-field total:    -234.567
  ...

FINAL REGIME:
  Type:             MIXED (Quantum-like)
  Deterministic:    67.4%
```

Shows how much of the system collapsed to deterministic vs stayed stochastic.

### The Graphs (right side)

**Top left (blue):** Ï†-field strength at each position
**Top right (red):** Ïˆ-field strength at each position
**Middle (bars):** Stability - green bars = deterministic, orange = needs sampling
**Bottom (line):** How system converged over iterations

## Try These Examples

### Example 1: Highly Deterministic
```
Input: aaa
Temperature: 1.0
Expected: >90% deterministic (lots of green bars)
```

### Example 2: Highly Stochastic
```
Input: xyz
Temperature: 2.0
Expected: <30% deterministic (mostly orange bars)
```

### Example 3: Mixed Regime
```
Input: hello world
Temperature: 1.0
Expected: 50-70% deterministic (mix of green/orange)
```

## Temperature Slider Explained

- **0.1 - 0.5:** Fast convergence, more deterministic
- **1.0:** Balanced (default)
- **1.5 - 2.0:** Slow convergence, more stochastic

Try the same text at different temperatures to see regime shift!

## Interpreting Results

### DETERMINISTIC Regime (>75%)
- System "knows" the answer
- Output is geometrically forced
- Like solving 2+2 - only one answer possible
- **This is P-like behavior**

### STOCHASTIC Regime (<35%)
- Multiple valid paths exist
- Need to sample/search
- Like solving sudoku - must try options
- **This is NP-like behavior**

### MIXED Regime (35-75%)
- Some parts forced, some parts free
- Quantum-like superposition
- Like partial sudoku - some cells forced, others need search
- **This is BQP-like behavior**

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do some characters have high Ï† values?**
A: Characters map to integers, which decompose into Fibonacci sums. Higher character values = higher Fibonacci terms = exponentially larger Ï† powers.

**Q: What are "shells"?**
A: The Fibonacci indices in the Zeckendorf decomposition. E.g., 17 = Fâ‚‡ + Fâ‚„ + Fâ‚‚ means shells=[7,4,2].

**Q: Why does convergence take different iterations?**
A: Depends on text complexity and temperature. Simple patterns converge fast, complex patterns need more cascade iterations.

**Q: What's the point of this?**
A: Demonstrates that the SAME mathematical substrate naturally produces both deterministic and stochastic behavior - explaining why some problems are easy (P) and others hard (NP).

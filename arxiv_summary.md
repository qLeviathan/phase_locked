### 4. **Key Theoretical Results**

#### Game Theory:
- **Backward Induction**: Optimal strategies follow V*(s) = max{u(s,a) + β·V*(s')}
- **Subgame Perfect Nash**: Strategy profile σ*(s) constitutes SPNE
- **Time Consistency**: β = 1/φ preserves preferences across time
- **Mixed Strategies**: Quantal response equilibrium with temperature

#### Econometrics:
- **Panel Structure**: Tokens as entities with fixed/random effects
- **Natural Experiments**: Zeckendorf provides exogenous variation  
- **DiD Identification**: δ_DiD = [Ȳ₁,post - Ȳ₁,pre] - [Ȳ₀,post - Ȳ₀,pre]
- **Causal Inference**: Future constraints satisfy exclusion restriction

#### Mechanism Design:
- **Incentive Compatible**: Truth-telling is dominant strategy
- **Pareto Optimal**: φ-allocation maximizes welfare
- **Revenue Equivalence**: φ-mechanism matches standard auctions

### 5. **Mathematical Innovations**

1. **Unity as Derived**: 1 = φ² - φ (not primitive)
2. **Addition-Only**: All operations reduce to integer addition
3. **Natural Termination**: E_t = E₀·φ^(-t) → 0
4. **Retrocausality = Backward Induction**: Future constrains past optimally

## Significance

This work establishes that language modeling can be fundamentally reconceptualized as a dynamic game where:
- The golden ratio provides natural discounting
- Fibonacci decomposition enables causal inference
- Panel data structure emerges naturally
- Equilibrium properties are provable

The unification of game theory, econometrics, and language modeling through φ as primitive suggests deep connections between information, strategy, and geometry.

# Mathematical Foundations of Φ-Mamba

## 1. The Golden Ratio as Primitive

Traditional mathematics treats 0 and 1 as primitive axioms. Φ-Mamba inverts this:

**Axiom**: φ = (1 + √5)/2 exists (the golden ratio)

From this single primitive, we derive:

### 1.1 Recursive Unity
```
φ² = φ + 1  (defining property)
φ² - φ = 1

Therefore: 1 = φ² - φ
```

Unity is not primitive - it's a φ-structure!

### 1.2 Zero Emergence
```
φ⁰ = 1 = φ² - φ
ln(φ⁰) = ln(1) = 0

Therefore: 0 = ln(φ⁰)
```

Zero emerges as the logarithmic identity.

### 1.3 Conjugate ψ
```
ψ = -1/φ = (1 - √5)/2

Properties:
- φ·ψ = -1
- φ + ψ = 1  
- φ - ψ = √5
- ψ² - ψ = 1 (same as φ)
```

## 2. Fibonacci-Lucas Foundation

### 2.1 Binet Formula
```
F_n = (φⁿ - ψⁿ)/√5  (Fibonacci)
L_n = φⁿ + ψⁿ       (Lucas)
```

### 2.2 Key Properties
- F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}
- φⁿ = F_n·φ + F_{n-1}
- F_{n+1}·F_{n-1} - F_n² = (-1)ⁿ (Cassini)

## 3. Logarithmic Duality

### 3.1 Multiplication → Addition
```
φⁿ × φᵐ = φⁿ⁺ᵐ
log_φ(xy) = log_φ(x) + log_φ(y)
```

ALL operations reduce to addition in log space!

### 3.2 The Triality
1. **Exponential**: n → φⁿ (index to value)
2. **Logarithm**: φⁿ → n (value to index)  
3. **Zeckendorf**: n → {F_k, F_j, ...} (index to topology)

## 4. Zeckendorf Decomposition

Every positive integer uniquely decomposes into non-adjacent Fibonacci numbers:

```
17 = F_7 + F_4 + F_2 = 13 + 3 + 1
Binary: 10101 (no adjacent 1s)
```

### 4.1 Topological Interpretation
- Each 1 = "hole" at that Fibonacci scale
- Each 0 = no hole at that scale
- Gap constraint = geometric necessity from φ² = φ + 1

### 4.2 Emergent Bits
Bits aren't stored - they emerge from checking hole existence:
```
has_hole(scale_k) ? 1 : 0
```

## 5. Berry Phase and Coherence

### 5.1 Berry Phase Calculation
```python
γ = Δθ · (1 + shell_overlap) + 2π·Δpos/N
```

Where:
- Δθ = angular difference
- shell_overlap = |shells₁ ∩ shells₂| / max(|shells₁|, |shells₂|)
- Δpos = position difference

### 5.2 Phase Lock Condition
```
γ ≡ 0 (mod 2π) → phase locked → coherent transition
γ ≢ 0 (mod 2π) → not locked → reflection needed
```

## 6. Pentagon Reflection

When phase lock fails:

### 6.1 Reflection Mechanism
```
θ' = π - θ  (mirror angle)
E' = E/φ    (energy scales down)
```

### 6.2 Natural Termination
After n reflections:
```
E_n = E_0/φⁿ

For n = 5: E_5 = E_0/11.09 < 0.1·E_0
```

Energy exhaustion → natural sentence boundary.

## 7. Retrocausal Encoding

### 7.1 Bidirectional Constraints
Forward: past → future (traditional)
Backward: future → past (retrocausal)

Both must agree at unity point (k=0).

### 7.2 Standing Waves
At each position k:
```
Standing wave = φᵏ + ψᵏ

At k=0: φ⁰ + ψ⁰ = 1 + 1 = 2 (constructive)
```

## 8. Cylinder Geometry

### 8.1 Token State
```
Token → (n, θ, r, z)
  n: Zeckendorf decomposition (active shells)
  θ: Angular position (token identity + position)
  r: Radial amplitude (φ-scaled)
  z: Causal layer (time-like)
```

### 8.2 Information Encoding
- Discrete: θ positions on circle
- Continuous: r amplitude
- Topological: n shell pattern
- Causal: z ordering

## 9. Lagrangian-Hamiltonian Duality

### 9.1 Lagrangian (Product Form)
```
L = ∏_k |T_k/V_k|^{F_{n-k}}
```

### 9.2 Action (Log Transform)
```
S = ln(L) = Σ_k F_{n-k}·ln|T_k/V_k|
```

### 9.3 Hamiltonian (Legendre Transform)
```
H = Σ_k F_{n-k}(T_k + V_k)
```

Fibonacci weights create natural shell structure.

## 10. Computational Advantages

### 10.1 Addition-Only Arithmetic
- Multiplication: n + m
- Division: n - m  
- Power: repeated addition
- All exact (no floating point errors)

### 10.2 Natural Properties
- Termination: Energy decay
- Coherence: Phase locking
- Compression: Zeckendorf optimal
- Parallelism: Independent shells

## Key Theorems

**Theorem 1**: Every integer has unique Zeckendorf decomposition.

**Theorem 2**: φ is the unique base where multiplication → addition exactly.

**Theorem 3**: Berry phase γ ≡ 0 (mod 2π) iff sequence is coherent.

**Theorem 4**: Energy E < φ⁻⁵ implies natural termination.

**Theorem 5**: Retrocausal encoding improves coherence by constraining from both temporal directions.
